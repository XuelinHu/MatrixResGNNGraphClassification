## Captions

**Figure 1. Architecture Overview.** Architecture overview of the compared residual neighborhoods on the branch-by-layer grid. The same message-passing backbone and graph-level readout are kept fixed while the residual routes are changed.

**Figure 2. Model-Level Winner Counts.** Model-level winner counts across the 24 dataset--operator combinations.

**Figure 3. GCNConv Benchmark.** GCNConv benchmark at \(B=3\). Bars show five-fold mean best test accuracy with fold-level standard-deviation error bars.

**Figure 4. Synthetic Multiclass Scaling.** Synthetic multi-class scaling from two to eight classes. Each point averages five synthetic graph families and four message-passing operators.

**Figure 5. Branch-Count Ablation.** Branch-count ablation for HorizontalRes, MatrixRes, and MatrixResGated on PROTEINS and DD under GCNConv. The curves are not monotonic: accuracy improves only within an effective operating region before saturating or declining.

**Figure 6. Mechanism Summary.** Mechanism summary linking branch-count accuracy to branch diversity, branch cosine similarity, branch CKA, and mean gradient norm.

**Figure 7. MatrixResGated Sensitivity.** Fold-0 MatrixResGated sensitivity scan at \(B=3\). The scan identifies candidate operating regions but is not treated as final hyperparameter evidence.
